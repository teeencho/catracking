Custom dimensions defined in our Google Analytics account.
Names include the custom dimension index and their scope, following
this specific pattern: CDX_SCOPE_NAME

There are 4 types of scopes: Hit, Session, User and Product.
HS (Hit Scope), SS (Session Scope), US (User Scope), PS (Product Scope).

These constants should be updated whenever we update the dimensions on GA.
